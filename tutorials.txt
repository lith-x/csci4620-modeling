Logging tutorials I use

Done:
Man v Monster: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vs_eSJUQPxBRaDS8PrVmIri
 - Learned a bit about materials and fog (volume)
 - Lots of object duplication, no object joining :\
   - I joined some objects together. Would've joined some meshes if I were recreating
     this on my own. Inefficient way of modelling (lots of separate mirror mods, etc.)

Low-Poly Well: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vu6pnoAtivKf5Bo_6oQS0N_
 - Learned nuggets about HDRI
 - Bend modifier
 - Grouping and ungrouping objects to modify
 - I used an alternative coloring method that was way quicker and achieved goals to a
   greater degree (Random -> ColorRamp -> Shader color)
