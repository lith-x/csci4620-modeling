Logging tutorials I use

Done:
Man v Monster: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vs_eSJUQPxBRaDS8PrVmIri
- Learned a bit about materials and fog (volume)
- Lots of object duplication, no object joining :\
  - I joined some objects together. Would've joined some meshes if I were recreating
    this on my own. Inefficient way of modelling (lots of separate mirror mods, etc.)

Low-Poly Well: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vu6pnoAtivKf5Bo_6oQS0N_
- Learned nuggets about HDRI
- Bend modifier
- Grouping and ungrouping objects to modify
- I used an alternative coloring method that was way quicker and achieved goals to a
  greater degree (Random -> ColorRamp -> Shader color)

Making this beautiful cave scene (Timelapse): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUsB7-d5p_A
- Trying to pick up on workflow and techniques that I liked about the scene presented in thumbnail
- Workflow notes
  - Start with most general and pervasive aspect of the scene (in this case, ground)
  - Used "Multires" modifier. What is that?
    - Blender 2.8 New Sculpt Feature - Multires modifier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgKxD19jsAI
      - Use case: simple sculpting with incredibly high-detail mesh (non-destructive anti-subdivide)
      - Preserve detail on higher-level subdivisions
