Logging tutorials I use

Done:
Man v Monster: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ukorJv4vs_eSJUQPxBRaDS8PrVmIri
 - Learned a bit about materials and fog (volume)
 - Lots of object duplication, no object joining :\
   - I joined some objects together. Would've joined some meshes if I were recreating
     this on my own. Inefficient way of modelling (lots of separate mirror mods, etc.)
